- 👋 Hi, I’m @wqj803
- 👀 I’m interested in how to initialize integration of Visual Studio Code with Git, Github, and Docker.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a good tutorial that provides a big picture and then walks through setup.
- 💞️ I’m surprised there isn't a wizard in Visual Studio Code to initialize a complete programming environment.
